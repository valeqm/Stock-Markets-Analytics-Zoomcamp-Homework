## Module 2 Homework (2025 Cohort)

In this homework, we're going to combine data from various sources to process it in Pandas and generate additional fields.

### Question 1: [IPO] Withdrawn IPOs by Company Type

**What is the total withdrawn IPO value (in $ millions) for the company class with the highest total withdrawal value?**

From the withdrawn IPO list ([stockanalysis.com/ipos/withdrawn](https://stockanalysis.com/ipos/withdrawn/)), collect and process the data to find out which company type saw the most withdrawn IPO value.

#### Steps:
1. Use `pandas.read_html()` with the URL above to load the IPO withdrawal table into a DataFrame. 
   *It is a similar process to Code Snippet 1 discussed at the livestream.*    You should get **99 entries**. 
2. Create a new column called `Company Class`, categorizing company names based on patterns like:
   - “Acquisition Corp” or “Acquisition Corporation” → `Acq.Corp`
   - “Inc” or “Incorporated” → `Inc`
   - “Group” → `Group`
   - “Ltd” or “Limited” → `Limited`
   - “Holdings” → `Holdings`
   - Others → `Other`

  *  Order: Please follow the listed order of classes and assign the first matched value (e.g., for 'shenni holdings limited', you assign the 'Limited' class).

  * Hint: make your function more robust by converting names to lowercase and splitting into words before matching patterns.

3. Define a new field `Avg. price` by parsing the `Price Range` field (create a function and apply it to the `Price Range` column). Examples:
   - '$8.00-$10.00' → `9.0`  
   - '$5.00' → `5.0`  
   - '-' → `None`
4. Convert `Shares Offered` to numeric, clean missing or invalid values.
5. Create a new column:  
   `Withdrawn Value = Shares Offered * Avg Price` (**71 non-null values**)
6. Group by `Company Class` and calculate total withdrawn value.
7. **Answer**: Which class had the highest **total** value of withdrawals?

### Question 2:   [IPO] Median Sharpe Ratio for 2024 IPOs (First 5 Months)


**What is the median Sharpe ratio (as of 6 June 2025) for companies that went public in the first 5 months of 2024?**

The goal is to replicate the large-scale `yfinance` OHLCV data download and perform basic financial calculations on IPO stocks.


#### Steps:

1. Using the same approach as in Question 1, download the IPOs in 2024 from:  
   [https://stockanalysis.com/ipos/2024/](https://stockanalysis.com/ipos/2024/)  
   Filter to keep only those IPOs **before 1 June 2024** (first 5 months of 2024).  
   ➤ You should have **75 tickers**.

2.  Use **Code Snippet 7** to download daily stock data for those tickers (via `yfinance`).  
   Make sure you understand how `growth_1d` ... `growth_365d`, and volatility columns are defined.  
   Define a new column `growth_252d` representing growth after **252 trading days** (~1 year), in addition to any other growth periods you already track.


3. Calculate the Sharpe ratio assuming a risk-free rate of **4.5%**:

   ```python
   stocks_df['Sharpe'] = (stocks_df['growth_252d'] - 0.045) / stocks_df['volatility']
   ```

   ⚠️ **IMPORTANT** Please use the original version of annualized volatility calculation (it was later corrected to another formula):
   ```python
   stocks_df['volatility'] =   stocks_df['Close'].rolling(30).std() * np.sqrt(252)
   ```
4. Filter the DataFrame to keep data only for the trading day:  
   **‘2025-06-06’**

   Compute descriptive statistics (e.g., `.describe()`) for these columns:  
   - `growth_252d`  
   - `Sharpe`

   You should observe:  
   - `growth_252d` is defined for **71 out of 75 stocks** (some IPOs are too recent or data starts later).  
   - Median `growth_252d` is approximately **0.75** (indicating a 25% decline), while mean is about **1.15**, showing a bias towards high-growth companies pushing the average up.

5. **Answer:**  
   - What is the **median Sharpe ratio** for these 71 stocks?  
   - Note: Positive `Sharpe` means growth exceeding the risk-free rate of 4.5%.  
   - [Additional] Do you observe the **same top 10 companies** when sorting by `growth_252d` versus sorting by `Sharpe`?

### Question 3: [IPO] ‘Fixed Months Holding Strategy’

**What is the optimal number of months (1 to 12) to hold a newly IPO'd stock in order to maximize average growth?**  
(*Assume you buy at the close of the first trading day and sell after a fixed number of trading days.*)


---

#### Goal:
Investigate whether holding an IPO stock for a fixed number of months after its first trading day produces better returns, using future growth columns.

---

#### Steps:

1. **Start from the existing DataFrame** from Question 2 (75 tickers from IPOs in the first 5 months of 2024).  

   Add **12 new columns**:  
   `future_growth_1m`, `future_growth_2m`, ..., `future_growth_12m`  
   *(Assume 1 month = 21 trading days, so growth is calculated over 21, 42, ..., 252 trading days)*  
   This logic is similar to `historyPrices['growth_future_30d']` from **Code Snippet 7**, but extended to longer timeframes.

2. **Determine the first trading day** (`min_date`) for each ticker.  
   This is the earliest date in the data for each stock.

3. **Join the data**:  
   Perform an **inner join** between the `min_date` DataFrame and the future growth data on both `ticker` and `date`.  
   ➤ You should end up with **75 records** (one per IPO) with all 12 `future_growth_...` fields populated.

4. **Compute descriptive statistics** for the resulting DataFrame:  
   Use `.describe()` or similar to analyze each of the 12 columns:  
   - `future_growth_1m`  
   - `future_growth_2m`  
   - ...  
   - `future_growth_12m`  

5. **Determine the best holding period**:  
   - Find the number of months **(1 to 12)** where the **average (mean)** future growth is **maximal**.  
   - This optimal month shows an uplift of **>1%** compared to all others.  
   - Still, the average return remains **less than 1** (i.e., expected return is less than doubling your investment).

### Question 4: [Strategy] Simple RSI-Based Trading Strategy


**What is the total profit (in $thousands) you would have earned by investing $1000 every time a stock was oversold (RSI < 25)?**


---

#### Goal:
Apply a simple rule-based trading strategy using the **Relative Strength Index (RSI)** technical indicator to identify oversold signals and calculate profits.

---


#### Steps:

1. **Run the full notebook from Lecture 2 (33 stocks)**  
   - Ensure you can generate the merged DataFrame containing:  
     - OHLCV data  
     - Technical indicators  
     - Macro indicators  
   - Focus on getting **RSI** computed using **Code Snippets 8 and 9**.  
   - This process is essential and will help during the capstone project.

2. ⚠️ **IMPORTANT** Please use this file to solve the Home Assignment (**all next steps**)
 
   Download precomputed data using this snippet:

   ```python
   import gdown
   import pandas as pd

   file_id = "1grCTCzMZKY5sJRtdbLVCXg8JXA8VPyg-"
   gdown.download(f"https://drive.google.com/uc?id={file_id}", "data.parquet", quiet=False)
   df = pd.read_parquet("data.parquet", engine="pyarrow")

3. **RSI Strategy Setup:**  
   - RSI is already available in the dataset as a field.  
   - The threshold for **oversold** is defined as `RSI < 25`.

4. **Filter the dataset by RSI and date:**  
   ```python
   rsi_threshold = 25
   selected_df = df[
       (df['rsi'] < rsi_threshold) &
       (df['Date'] >= '2000-01-01') &
       (df['Date'] <= '2025-06-01')
   ]
5. **Calculate Net Profit Over 25 Years:**  
   - Total number of trades: **1568**  
   - For each trade, you invest **$1000**  
   - Use the 30-day forward return (`growth_future_30d`) to compute net earnings:  
     ```python
     net_income = 1000 * (selected_df['growth_future_30d'] - 1).sum()
     ```

   - **Final Answer:**  
     What is the **net income in $K** (i.e., in thousands of dollars) that could be earned using this RSI-based oversold strategy from 2000–2025?

### Q5. [Exploratory, Optional] Predicting a Positive-Return IPO

Most of the strategies for investing in IPOs deliver **negative average and median returns** (and even 75% quantiles).

**Question:**  
How would you change the strategy if you want to **increase the profitability**?

> This is an open-ended brainstorming question — propose ideas for identifying IPOs with positive future returns or building a more effective trading strategy.
